# NCBI SARS COV-2 Data Crawler
A crawler which crawls the atcg sequence of the novel corona-virus2
found all over the world. This data is being uploaded at the ncbi
website.

## What does it do?
It scrapes data from the ncbi website and currently only crawls the atcg
sequence data being uploaded on the website. Other meta-data is not collected
currently.

The atcg sequence is stored in XXX.txt files in a directory given as
input by the user. So, if there are 2000 accessions, then there would be
2000 .txt files.
